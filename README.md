A minimalistic toto-app

## Goals

To create a minimalistic todo-app that showcases some of my skills and values. Specifically, I want this to be

- simple and minimalistic. Only containing only what I want and need. Less is more
- developed with mobile in mind. Later I might want to migrate this to react-native
- It should be like a paper todo-notebook you can bring everywhere, but on your phone. This is so that you dont have to bring the notebook and a pen everywhere

## User stories

- As a user, I want to add what I want a todo-task for a given day, so that I can keep track of what I need to do
- As a user, I want to cross out completed todo-tasks, so that I know which ones I have completed
- As a user, I want to look at what tasks I have done earlier, so that I can look back at what I have done in the past
